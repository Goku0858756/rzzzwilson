This is a rewrite of mtkbabel-0.8.3.1 from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mtkbabel/].
This version will try to be more pythonic in things like reading from the device (use
generators?)

The file mtkbabel.pl is the base file from the above project.  The mtkbabel.py is the
python rewrite.  The log.py file is a logging module for debug.

The file data2kml.py converts a GPX file output by mtkbabel.pl into a Google Earth
KML file.

Files:
data2kml.py	utility code to create a KML from a track dump
log.py		simple logging
mtkbabel.pl	original perl program
pymtkbabel.py	the python version for QStarz BT-Q1300ST device

NOTE: this version is a very dirty 'clone' of the original perl.  More pythonic
in the next version!

NOTE: the original development of this was done on OSX.  Unfortunately, since
Yosemite (10.10) the QStarz BT-Q1300ST device isn't mounted under OSX.  Development
was switched to Linux (XUbuntu) at that point.
