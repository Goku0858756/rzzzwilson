This directory contains pyCacheBack which is an exercise in extending
a builtin data structure (the dictionary).

pyCacheBack behaves like a dictionary but has an LRU mechanism [1]
to limit the number of keys in the dictionary.  There is an optional
'backing store' mechanism that could be used to store key/value
pairs on disk (for instance).

The ay to use the backing store is to inherit from pyCacheBack with
overridden methods _put_to_back() and _get_from_back().  See the test
code for an example.
