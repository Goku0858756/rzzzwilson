The first thing that comes to mind is that the centre of mass of a swarm
of particles each moving with constant velocity is itself constant.  That
is, the centre of mass of the swarm has constant speed and direction
(a straight line).

So all we need to do is determine the (x, y, z, vx, vy, vz) values for
the swarm centre of mass at time T=0, determine the point of closest
aproach to (0, 0, 0) and then calculate the time at which that happens.

Sounds simple.  Too simple?

If we get a result for t_min negative, return the initial cofm distance
and time 0.0.

Calculate the cofm vx, vy, vz by stepping each firefly 1.0 seconds in time,
calculating the new position, recalculate new cofm position, thereby
getting cofm velocity.  There should be a formulaic solution to this!?

Formulaic solution
------------------
We have position and velocities of all fireflies at time 0.

Calculate CofM of mass at time 0:
c0 = average(sum(c0x)), ...

Calculate CofM velocity at time 0:
cv0 = average(sum(cv0x), ...

Figure out time at which CofM will strike a boundary, ie, time tb at which
any coordinate goes to 5000 or -5000.

Calculate CofM position at time tb: cb

Using the algorithm at
[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Point-LineDistance3-Dimensional.html]
calculate the time tc of closest approach to the origin.
x1 is c0
x2 is cb
x0 is origin

Calculate the position of CofM at time tc.

Calculate the distance from the origin at time tc.
