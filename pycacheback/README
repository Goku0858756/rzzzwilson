This directory contains pyCacheBack which is an exercise in extending
a builtin data structure (the dictionary).

pyCacheBack behaves like a dictionary but has an LRU mechanism [1]
to limit the number of keys in the dictionary.  There is an optional
'backing store' mechanism that could be used to store key/value
pairs on disk (for instance).  Something like this is useful in an
application that uses OpenStreetMap tiles from the web as the tiles
can be cached in memory for speed and saved to disk to save on web
accesses.

The way to use the backing store is to inherit from pyCacheBack with
overridden methods _put_to_back() and _get_from_back().  See the test
code for an example.
